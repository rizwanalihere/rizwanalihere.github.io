👨🏻‍💻 I'm a final-year graduate student at Nankai University.

🔬 My research interests are in using plants for bioremediation!

📚 I'm currently performing experiments & analysing data to write research papers.

🎮🚁 Beyond research, I volunteer with The Photography & Drone Association at Nankai University!


## 👨🏻‍🔬 Professional Experience
Currently I am working as a **Student Researcher** at the Key Laboratory of pollution Processes and Environmental Criteria at Nankai University under the supervision of Prof. Liu Jianv working on **Phytoremediation using ornamental & aquatic plants**.
