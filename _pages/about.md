![Illustration of phytoremediation using plants](images/May 19, 2025, 09_25_39 AM.png){: .align-right width="300px"}
👨🏻‍💻 I'm a final-year graduate student at Nankai University.

🔬 My research interests are in using plants for bioremediation!

📚 I'm currently performing experiments & analysing data to write research papers.

🎮🚁 Beyond research, I volunteer with The Photography & Drone Association at Nankai University!

# Selected Experience

## 🤖 Open Source Contributions
I have experience contributing to [Arena Bench](https://github.com/Arena-Rosnav) a large open-source project for robotic obstacle avoidance using Deep Reinforcement Learning.

Moreover, I have published a [respective paper](https://sudo-boris.github.io/publication/2022-Arena-Bench) at the IROS conference and in the Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) journal.

# 📜 Reimplementing and Reproducing Papers
I have experience with independent research. I have implemented the Reward Constrained Policy Optimization paper into stable-baselines3 PPO and reproduced the original results by running and tracking experiments.

To accompany this work, I have submitted a blog post to the **ICLR** Blogposts Track communicating the paper's theory and my results.

Feel free to look at my specific [portfolio entry](https://sudo-boris.github.io/portfolio/RCPPO/).

## 👨🏻‍🔬 Professional Experience
Currently I am working as a **Student Researcher** at the Key Laboratory of pollution Processes and Environmental Criteria at Nankai University under the supervision of Prof. Liu Jianv working on **Phytoremediation using ornamental & aquatic plants**.

# 📚 Teaching and Community Contributions
To further contribute to the Machine Learning community, I have a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@borismeinardus) and [Medium](https://medium.com/@boris.meinardus) channel where I publish educational Machine Learning content.
